## Backend Boilerplate
A scalable and secure backend boilerplate for building Node.js/Express applications. This setup includes authentication, MongoDB integration, and middleware for a production-ready backend API.

## Features
Express.js Framework: Lightweight and extensible.
MongoDB Integration: Pre-configured with Mongoose for schema-based data modeling.
JWT Authentication: Includes ready-to-use register and login endpoints with JWT-based authentication.
Validation Middleware: Input validation using express-validator.
Error Handling: Centralized error-handling middleware for clean and consistent responses.
Secure Routes: Middleware (protect) to guard protected routes.
